It is\n numbered 2 because it goes with version 2 of the ordinary GPL.]\n\n                Preamble\n\n  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your\nfreedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public\nLicenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change\nfree software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.\n\n  This license, the Library General Public License, applies to some\nspecially designated Free Software Foundation software, and to any\nother libraries whose authors decide to use it.  You can use it for\nyour libraries, too.\n\n  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not\nprice.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you\nhave the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for\nthis service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it\nif you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it\nin new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.\n\n  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid\nanyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.\nThese restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if\nyou distribute copies of the library, or if you modify it.\n\n  For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis\nor for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave\nyou.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source\ncode.  If you link a program with the library, you must provide\ncomplete object files to the recipients so that they can relink them\nwith the library, after making changes to the library and recompiling\nit.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.\n\n  Our method of protecting your rights has two steps: (1) copyright\nthe library, and (2) offer you this license which gives you legal\npermission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.\n\n  Also, for each distributor's protection, we want to make certain\nthat everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free\nlibrary.  If the library is modified by someone else and passed on, we\nwant its recipients to know that what they have is not the original\nversion, so that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on\nthe original authors' reputations.\n\f\n  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software\npatents.  We wish to avoid the danger that companies distributing free\nsoftware will individually obtain patent licenses, thus in effect\ntransforming the program into proprietary software.  To prevent this,\nwe have made it clear that any patent must be licensed for everyone's\nfree use or not licensed at all.\n\n  Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the ordinary\nGNU General Public License, which was designed for utility programs.  This\nlicense, the GNU Library General Public License, applies to certain\ndesignated libraries.  This license is quite different from the ordinary\none; be sure to read it in full, and don't assume that anything in it is\nthe same as in the ordinary license.\n\n  The reason we have a separate public license for some libraries is that\nthey blur the distinction we usually make between modifying or adding to a\nprogram and simply using it.  Linking a program with a library, without\nchanging the library, is in some sense simply using the library, and is\nanalogous to running a utility program or application program.  However, in\na textual and legal sense, the linked executable is a combined work, a\nderivative of the original library, and the ordinary General Public License\ntreats it as such.\n\n  Because of this blurred distinction, using the ordinary General\nPublic License for libraries did not effectively promote software\nsharing, because most developers did not use the libraries.  We\nconcluded that weaker conditions might promote sharing better.\n\n  However, unrestricted linking of non-free programs would deprive the\nusers of those programs of all benefit from the free status of the\nlibraries themselves.  This Library General Public License is intended to\npermit developers of non-free programs to use free libraries, while\npreserving your freedom as a user of such programs to change the free\nlibraries that are incorporated in them.  (We have not seen how to achieve\nthis as regards changes in header files, but we have achieved it as regards\nchanges in the actual functions of the Library.)  The hope is that this\nwill lead to faster development of free libraries.\n\n  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\nmodification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a\n\"work based on the library\" and a \"work that uses the library\".  The\nformer contains code derived from the library, while the latter only\nworks together with the library.\n\n  Note that it is possible for a library to be covered by the ordinary\nGeneral Public License rather than by this special one.\n\f\n          GNU LIBRARY GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\n   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\n\n  0. This License Agreement applies to any software library which\ncontains a notice placed by the copyright holder or other authorized\nparty saying it may be distributed under the terms of this Library\nGeneral Public License (also called \"this License\").  Each licensee is\naddressed as \"you\".\n\n  A \"library\" means a collection of software functions and/or data\nprepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs\n(which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.\n\n  The \"Library\", below, refers to any such software library or work\nwhich has been distributed under these terms.  A \"work based on the\nLibrary\" means either the Library or any derivative work under\ncopyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a\nportion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated\nstraightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is\nincluded without limitation in the term \"modification\".)\n\n  \"Source code\" for a work means the preferred form of the work for\nmaking modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code means\nall the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated\ninterface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation\nand installation of the library.\n\n  Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not\ncovered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of\nrunning a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from\nsuch a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based\non the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for\nwriting it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library does\nand what the program that uses the Library does.\n\n  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's\ncomplete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that\nyou conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an\nappropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact\nall the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any\nwarranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the\nLibrary.\n\n  You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,\nand you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a\nfee.\n\f\n  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion\nof it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and\ndistribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1\nabove, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n\n    a) The modified work must itself be a software library.\n\n    b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices\n    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.\n\n    c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no\n    charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.\n\n    d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a\n    table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses\n    the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility\n    is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,\n    in the event an application does not supply such function or\n    table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of\n    its purpose remains meaningful.\n\n    (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has\n    a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the\n    application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any\n    application-supplied function or table used by this function must\n    be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square\n    root function must still compute square roots.)\n\nThese requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If\nidentifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,\nand can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in\nthemselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those\nsections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you\ndistribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based\non the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of\nthis License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the\nentire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote\nit.\n\nThus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest\nyour rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to\nexercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or\ncollective works based on the Library.\n\nIn addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library\nwith the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of\na storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under\nthe scope of this License.\n\n  3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public\nLicense instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.  To do\nthis, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so\nthat they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,\ninstead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version 2 of the\nordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify\nthat version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change in\nthese notices.\n\f\n  Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for\nthat copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all\nsubsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.\n\n  This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of\nthe Library into a program that is not a library.\n\n  4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or\nderivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form\nunder the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany\nit with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which\nmust be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a\nmedium customarily used for software interchange.\n\n  If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy\nfrom a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the\nsource code from the same place satisfies the requirement to\ndistribute the source code, even though third parties are not\ncompelled to copy the source along with the object code.\n\n  5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the\nLibrary, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or\nlinked with it, is called a \"work that uses the Library\".  Such a\nwork, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and\ntherefore falls outside the scope of this License.\n\n  However, linking a \"work that uses the Library\" with the Library\ncreates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it\ncontains portions of the Library), rather than a \"work that uses the\nlibrary\".  The executable is therefore covered by this License.\nSection 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.\n\n  When a \"work that uses the Library\" uses material from a header file\nthat is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a\nderivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.\nWhether this is true is especially significant if the work can be\nlinked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.  The\nthreshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.\n\n  If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data\nstructure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline\nfunctions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object\nfile is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative\nwork.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the\nLibrary will still fall under Section 6.)\n\n  Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may\ndistribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.\nAny executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,\nwhether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.\n\f\n  6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also compile or\nlink a \"work that uses the Library\" with the Library to produce a\nwork containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work\nunder terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit\nmodification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse\nengineering for debugging such modifications.\n\n  You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the\nLibrary is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by\nthis License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the work\nduring execution displays copyright notices, you must include the\ncopyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference\ndirecting the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must do one\nof these things:\n\n    a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding\n    machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever\n    changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under\n    Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked\n    with the Library, with the complete machine-readable \"work that\n    uses the Library\", as object code and/or source code, so that the\n    user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified\n    executable containing the modified Library.  (It is understood\n    that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the\n    Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application\n    to use the modified definitions.)\n\n    b) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at\n    least three years, to give the same user the materials\n    specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more\n    than the cost of performing this distribution.\n\n    c) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy\n    from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above\n    specified materials from the same place.\n\n    d) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these\n    materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.\n\n  For an executable, the required form of the \"work that uses the\nLibrary\" must include any data and utility programs needed for\nreproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception,\nthe source code distributed need not include anything that is normally\ndistributed (in either source or binary form) with the major\ncomponents (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on\nwhich the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies\nthe executable.\n\n  It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license\nrestrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally\naccompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you cannot\nuse both them and the Library together in an executable that you\ndistribute.\n\f\n  7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the\nLibrary side-by-side in a single library together with other library\nfacilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined\nlibrary, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on\nthe Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise\npermitted, and provided that you do these two things:\n\n    a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work\n    based on the Library, uncombined with any other library\n    facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the\n    Sections above.\n\n    b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact\n    that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining\n    where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.\n\n  8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute\nthe Library except as expressly provided under this License.  Any\nattempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or\ndistribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your\nrights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies,\nor rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses\nterminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.\n\n  9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not\nsigned it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or\ndistribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions are\nprohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by\nmodifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the\nLibrary), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and\nall its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying\nthe Library or works based on it.\n\n  10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the\nLibrary), the recipient automatically receives a license from the\noriginal licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library\nsubject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further\nrestrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.\nYou are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to\nthis License.\n\f\n  11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent\ninfringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),\nconditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\notherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\nexcuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot\ndistribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\nLicense and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you\nmay not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent\nlicense would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by\nall those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then\nthe only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to\nrefrain entirely from distribution of the Library.\n\nIf any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any\nparticular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply,\nand the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.\n\nIt is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any\npatents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any\nsuch claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the\nintegrity of the free software distribution system which is\nimplemented by public license practices.  Many people have made\ngenerous contributions to the wide range of software distributed\nthrough that system in reliance on consistent application of that\nsystem; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing\nto distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot\nimpose that choice.\n\nThis section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to\nbe a consequence of the rest of this License.\n\n  12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in\ncertain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the\noriginal copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add\nan explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries,\nso that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus\nexcluded.  In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if\nwritten in the body of this License.\n\n  13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new\nversions of the Library General Public License from time to time.\nSuch new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,\nbut may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.\n\nEach version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Library\nspecifies a version number of this License which applies to it and\n\"any later version\", you have the option of following the terms and\nconditions either of that version or of any later version published by\nthe Free Software Foundation.  If the Library does not specify a\nlicense version number, you may choose any version ever published by\nthe Free Software Foundation.\n\f\n  14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free\nprograms whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,\nwrite to the author to ask for permission.  For software which is\ncopyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free\nSoftware Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our\ndecision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status\nof all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing\nand reuse of software generally.\n\n                NO WARRANTY\n\n  15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO\nWARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.\nEXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR\nOTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY\nKIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE\nIMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR\nPURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE\nLIBRARY IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME\nTHE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n\n  16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN\nWRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY\nAND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU\nFOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR\nCONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE\nLIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING\nRENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A\nFAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF\nSUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH\nDAMAGES.\n\n             END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n</code></pre>"},{"location":"LICENSE-DEPENDENCIES.html#isorelaxisorelax","title":"isorelax:isorelax","text":"<p>MIT</p> <p>http://iso-relax.sourceforge.net/</p> <pre><code>Copyright (c) 2001-2002, SourceForge ISO-RELAX Project (ASAMI\nTomoharu, Daisuke Okajima, Kohsuke Kawaguchi, and MURATA Makoto)\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining\na copy of this software and associated documentation files (the\n\"Software\"), to deal in the Software without restriction, including\nwithout limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish,\ndistribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to\npermit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to\nthe following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be\nincluded in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,\nEXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF\nMERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND\nNONINFRINGEMENT.

License Grants and Conditions\n--------------------------------\n\n2.1. Grants\n\nEach Contributor hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free,\nnon-exclusive license:\n\n(a) under intellectual property rights (other than patent or trademark)\n    Licensable by such Contributor to use, reproduce, make available,\n    modify, display, perform, distribute, and otherwise exploit its\n    Contributions, either on an unmodified basis, with Modifications, or\n    as part of a Larger Work; and\n\n(b) under Patent Claims of such Contributor to make, use, sell, offer\n    for sale, have made, import, and otherwise transfer either its\n    Contributions or its Contributor Version.\n\n2.2. Effective Date\n\nThe licenses granted in Section 2.1 with respect to any Contribution\nbecome effective for each Contribution on the date the Contributor first\ndistributes such Contribution.\n\n2.3. Limitations on Grant Scope\n\nThe licenses granted in this Section 2 are the only rights granted under\nthis License. No additional rights or licenses will be implied from the\ndistribution or licensing of Covered Software under this License.\nNotwithstanding Section 2.1(b) above, no patent license is granted by a\nContributor:\n\n(a) for any code that a Contributor has removed from Covered Software;\n    or\n\n(b) for infringements caused by: (i) Your and any other third party's\n    modifications of Covered Software, or (ii) the combination of its\n    Contributions with other software (except as part of its Contributor\n    Version); or\n\n(c) under Patent Claims infringed by Covered Software in the absence of\n    its Contributions.\n\nThis License does not grant any rights in the trademarks, service marks,\nor logos of any Contributor (except as may be necessary to comply with\nthe notice requirements in Section 3.4).\n\n2.4. Subsequent Licenses\n\nNo Contributor makes additional grants as a result of Your choice to\ndistribute the Covered Software under a subsequent version of this\nLicense (see Section 10.2) or under the terms of a Secondary License (if\npermitted under the terms of Section 3.3).\n\n2.5. Representation\n\nEach Contributor represents that the Contributor believes its\nContributions are its original creation(s) or it has sufficient rights\nto grant the rights to its Contributions conveyed by this License.\n\n2.6. Fair Use\n\nThis License is not intended to limit any rights You have under\napplicable copyright doctrines of fair use, fair dealing, or other\nequivalents.\n\n2.7. Conditions\n\nSections 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, and 3.4 are conditions of the licenses granted\nin Section 2.1.\n\n3. Responsibilities\n-------------------\n\n3.1. Distribution of Source Form\n\nAll distribution of Covered Software in Source Code Form, including any\nModifications that You create or to which You contribute, must be under\nthe terms of this License. You must inform recipients that the Source\nCode Form of the Covered Software is governed by the terms of this\nLicense, and how they can obtain a copy of this License. You may not\nattempt to alter or restrict the recipients' rights in the Source Code\nForm.\n\n3.2. Distribution of Executable Form\n\nIf You distribute Covered Software in Executable Form then:\n\n(a) such Covered Software must also be made available in Source Code\n    Form, as described in Section 3.1, and You must inform recipients of\n    the Executable Form how they can obtain a copy of such Source Code\n    Form by reasonable means in a timely manner, at a charge no more\n    than the cost of distribution to the recipient; and\n\n(b) You may distribute such Executable Form under the terms of this\n    License, or sublicense it under different terms, provided that the\n    license for the Executable Form does not attempt to limit or alter\n    the recipients' rights in the Source Code Form under this License.\n\n3.3. Distribution of a Larger Work\n\nYou may create and distribute a Larger Work under terms of Your choice,\nprovided that You also comply with the requirements of this License for\nthe Covered Software. If the Larger Work is a combination of Covered\nSoftware with a work governed by one or more Secondary Licenses, and the\nCovered Software is not Incompatible With Secondary Licenses, this\nLicense permits You to additionally distribute such Covered Software\nunder the terms of such Secondary License(s), so that the recipient of\nthe Larger Work may, at their option, further distribute the Covered\nSoftware under the terms of either this License or such Secondary\nLicense(s).\n\n3.4. Notices\n\nYou may not remove or alter the substance of any license notices\n(including copyright notices, patent notices, disclaimers of warranty,\nor limitations of liability) contained within the Source Code Form of\nthe Covered Software, except that You may alter any license notices to\nthe extent required to remedy known factual inaccuracies.\n\n3.5. Application of Additional Terms\n\nYou may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support,\nindemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered\nSoftware. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on\nbehalf of any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any\nsuch warranty, support, indemnity, or liability obligation is offered by\nYou alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify every Contributor for any\nliability incurred by such Contributor as a result of warranty, support,\nindemnity or liability terms You offer. You may include additional\ndisclaimers of warranty and limitations of liability specific to any\njurisdiction.\n\n4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation\n---------------------------------------------------\n\nIf it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this\nLicense with respect to some or all of the Covered Software due to\nstatute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with\nthe terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b)\ndescribe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description must\nbe placed in a text file included with all distributions of the Covered\nSoftware under this License. Except to the extent prohibited by statute\nor regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed for a\nrecipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.\n\n5. Termination\n--------------\n\n5.1. The rights granted under this License will terminate automatically\nif You fail to comply with any of its terms. However, if You become\ncompliant, then the rights granted under this License from a particular\nContributor are reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until such\nContributor explicitly and finally terminates Your grants, and (b) on an\nongoing basis, if such Contributor fails to notify You of the\nnon-compliance by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after You have\ncome back into compliance. Moreover, Your grants from a particular\nContributor are reinstated on an ongoing basis if such Contributor\nnotifies You of the non-compliance by some reasonable means, this is the\nfirst time You have received notice of non-compliance with this License\nfrom such Contributor, and You become compliant prior to 30 days after\nYour receipt of the notice.\n\n5.2. If You initiate litigation against any entity by asserting a patent\ninfringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions,\ncounter-claims, and cross-claims) alleging that a Contributor Version\ndirectly or indirectly infringes any patent, then the rights granted to\nYou by any and all Contributors for the Covered Software under Section\n2.1 of this License shall terminate.\n\n5.3. In the event of termination under Sections 5.1 or 5.2 above, all\nend user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which\nhave been validly granted by You or Your distributors under this License\nprior to termination shall survive termination.\n\n************************************************************************\n*                                                                      *\n*  6.

Litigation\n-------------\n\nAny litigation relating to this License may be brought only in the\ncourts of a jurisdiction where the defendant maintains its principal\nplace of business and such litigation shall be governed by laws of that\njurisdiction, without reference to its conflict-of-law provisions.\nNothing in this Section shall prevent a party's ability to bring\ncross-claims or counter-claims.\n\n9. Miscellaneous\n----------------\n\nThis License represents the complete agreement concerning the subject\nmatter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be\nunenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent\nnecessary to make it enforceable. Any law or regulation which provides\nthat the language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter\nshall not be used to construe this License against a Contributor.\n\n10. Versions of the License\n---------------------------\n\n10.1. New Versions\n\nMozilla Foundation is the license steward. Except as provided in Section\n10.3, no one other than the license steward has the right to modify or\npublish new versions of this License. Each version will be given a\ndistinguishing version number.\n\n10.2. Effect of New Versions\n\nYou may distribute the Covered Software under the terms of the version\nof the License under which You originally received the Covered Software,\nor under the terms of any subsequent version published by the license\nsteward.\n\n10.3.

But for reasons I don't fully understand, many Rubies on Darwin seem to load the libxml2 and libxslt dylibs that ship with XCode commandline tools (\"CLT\"), and so every libxml2 symbol is a collision and resolves to the wrong libxml2 (not the version we've patched and statically linked into the extension).</p> <p>To work around this last problem, the best solution we know of right now seems to be to avoid exporting those symbols by using the <code>-load_hidden</code> flag (or a similar mechanism, there are several we could choose from).</p>"},{"location":"adr/2022-12-darwin-symbol-resolution.html#decision","title":"Decision","text":"<p>Nokogiri v1.14.0's precompiled native gem for Darwin (MacOS) Ruby 3.2 will be built with:</p> <ul> <li>the <code>-flat_namespace</code> flag to ensure the extension can be used by both <code>--enable-shared</code> and <code>--disable-shared</code> Rubies,</li> <li>and the <code>-load_hidden</code> flag for both <code>libxml2</code> and <code>libxslt</code> to avoid accidentally resolving to non-vendored versions of those libraries</li> </ul>"},{"location":"adr/2022-12-darwin-symbol-resolution.html#consequences","title":"Consequences","text":"<p>This would prevent accidental symbol collisions such as the https://github.com/sparklemotion/nokogiri/pull/2106 on Linux, and would ensure that we always pull in the desired version of libxml2, avoiding problems like the ones we're currently experiencing with Ruby 3.2 (see https://github.com/rake-compiler/rake-compiler-dock/issues/87 for extended discussion and more links).</p> <p>This would also, however, prevent a small but non-zero number of downstream gems from integrating with Nokogiri's C API, or the C API of libxml2, libxslt, or libgumbo. A notable gem that did this was https://github.com/rubys/nokogumbo (now merged into Nokogiri itself). Another notable gem that I know that does this is <code>nokogiri-xmlsec</code> (and the various forks of it, the most popular seems to be https://github.com/instructure/nokogiri-xmlsec-instructure).

For now, though, I'd like to keep our options open and not break compatibility completely in this v1.14.0 release.

Here is an example of explicitly setting the encoding to EUC-JP on the parser:</p> <pre><code>doc = Nokogiri.XML('&lt;foo&gt;&lt;bar /&gt;&lt;foo&gt;', nil, 'EUC-JP')\n</code></pre>"},{"location":"tutorials/searching_a_xml_html_document.html","title":"Searching an HTML / XML Document","text":""},{"location":"tutorials/searching_a_xml_html_document.html#basic-searching","title":"Basic Searching","text":"<p>Let's suppose you have the following document:</p> <pre><code>[shows.xml]\n&lt;root&gt;\n  &lt;sitcoms&gt;\n    &lt;sitcom&gt;\n      &lt;name&gt;Married with Children&lt;/name&gt;\n      &lt;characters&gt;\n        &lt;character&gt;Al Bundy&lt;/character&gt;\n        &lt;character&gt;Bud Bundy&lt;/character&gt;\n        &lt;character&gt;Marcy Darcy&lt;/character&gt;\n      &lt;/characters&gt;\n    &lt;/sitcom&gt;\n    &lt;sitcom&gt;\n      &lt;name&gt;Perfect Strangers&lt;/name&gt;\n      &lt;characters&gt;\n        &lt;character&gt;Larry Appleton&lt;/character&gt;\n        &lt;character&gt;Balki Bartokomous&lt;/character&gt;\n      &lt;/characters&gt;\n    &lt;/sitcom&gt;\n  &lt;/sitcoms&gt;\n  &lt;dramas&gt;\n    &lt;drama&gt;\n      &lt;name&gt;The A-Team&lt;/name&gt;\n      &lt;characters&gt;\n        &lt;character&gt;John \"Hannibal\" Smith&lt;/character&gt;\n        &lt;character&gt;Templeton \"Face\" Peck&lt;/character&gt;\n        &lt;character&gt;\"B.A.\" Baracus&lt;/character&gt;\n        &lt;character&gt;\"Howling Mad\" Murdock&lt;/character&gt;\n      &lt;/characters&gt;\n    &lt;/drama&gt;\n  &lt;/dramas&gt;\n&lt;/root&gt;\n</code></pre> <p>Let's further suppose that you want a list of all the characters in all the shows in this document.</p> <pre><code>@doc = Nokogiri::XML(File.open(\"shows.xml\"))\n@doc.xpath(\"//character\")\n# =&gt; [\"&lt;character&gt;Al Bundy&lt;/character&gt;\",\n#    \"&lt;character&gt;Bud Bundy&lt;/character&gt;\",\n#    \"&lt;character&gt;Marcy Darcy&lt;/character&gt;\",\n#    \"&lt;character&gt;Larry Appleton&lt;/character&gt;\",\n#    \"&lt;character&gt;Balki Bartokomous&lt;/character&gt;\",\n#    \"&lt;character&gt;John \\\"Hannibal\\\" Smith&lt;/character&gt;\",\n#    \"&lt;character&gt;Templeton \\\"Face\\\" Peck&lt;/character&gt;\",\n#    \"&lt;character&gt;\\\"B.A.\\\" Baracus&lt;/character&gt;\",\n#    \"&lt;character&gt;\\\"Howling Mad\\\" Murdock&lt;/character&gt;\"]\n</code></pre> <p>The <code>Node</code> methods <code>xpath</code> and <code>css</code> actually return a NodeSet, which acts very much like an array, and contains matching nodes from the document.</p> <pre><code>characters = @doc.xpath(\"//character\")\ncharacters[0].to_s # =&gt; \"&lt;character&gt;Al Bundy&lt;/character&gt;\"\n</code></pre> <p>You can use any XPath or CSS query you like (see the chapter on XPath and CSS syntax for more information).</p> <pre><code>@doc.xpath(\"//dramas//character\")\n# =&gt; [\"&lt;character&gt;John \\\"Hannibal\\\" Smith&lt;/character&gt;\",\n#    \"&lt;character&gt;Templeton \\\"Face\\\" Peck&lt;/character&gt;\",\n#    \"&lt;character&gt;\\\"B.A.\\\" Baracus&lt;/character&gt;\",\n#    \"&lt;character&gt;\\\"Howling Mad\\\" Murdock&lt;/character&gt;\"]\n</code></pre> <p>Notably, you can even use CSS queries in an XML document!</p> <pre><code>characters = @doc.css(\"sitcoms name\") # =&gt; [\"&lt;name&gt;Married with Children&lt;/name&gt;\", \"&lt;name&gt;Perfect Strangers&lt;/name&gt;\"]\n</code></pre> <p>CSS queries are often the easiest and most succinct way to express what you're looking for, so don't be afraid to use them!</p>"},{"location":"tutorials/searching_a_xml_html_document.html#single-results","title":"Single Results","text":"<p>If you know you're going to get only a single result back, you can use the shortcuts <code>at_css</code> and <code>at_xpath</code> instead of having to access the first element of a NodeSet.</p> <pre><code>@doc.css(\"dramas name\").first # =&gt; \"&lt;name&gt;The A-Team&lt;/name&gt;\"\n@doc.at_css(\"dramas name\")    # =&gt; \"&lt;name&gt;The A-Team&lt;/name&gt;\"\n</code></pre>"},{"location":"tutorials/searching_a_xml_html_document.html#namespaces","title":"Namespaces","text":"<p>Just like our Ruby code, XML can suffer from name collisions.  For example, an autoparts dealer can sell tires and so can a bike dealer.  Both of them may use a \"tire\" tag to describe the tires they sell.  However, we need to be able to tell the difference between a car tire and a bike tire.  This is where namespaces come to the rescue.</p> <p>Namespaces associate tags with a unique URL.  Let's take a look at the autoparts store's XML versus the bike stores:</p> <pre><code>[parts.xml]\n&lt;parts&gt;\n  &lt;!-- Alice's Auto Parts Store --&gt;\n  &lt;inventory xmlns=\"http://alicesautoparts.com/\"&gt;\n    &lt;tire&gt;all weather&lt;/tire&gt;\n    &lt;tire&gt;studded&lt;/tire&gt;\n    &lt;tire&gt;extra wide&lt;/tire&gt;\n  &lt;/inventory&gt;\n\n  &lt;!-- Bob's Bike Shop --&gt;\n  &lt;inventory xmlns=\"http://bobsbikes.com/\"&gt;\n    &lt;tire&gt;street&lt;/tire&gt;\n    &lt;tire&gt;mountain&lt;/tire&gt;\n  &lt;/inventory&gt;\n&lt;/parts&gt;\n</code></pre> <p>Since the URLs are unique, we can associate our query with a URL and get only the tires belonging to that url:</p> <pre><code>@doc = Nokogiri::XML(File.read(\"parts.xml\"))\n\ncar_tires = @doc.xpath('//car:tire', 'car' =&gt; 'http://alicesautoparts.com/')\n# =&gt; [\"&lt;tire&gt;all weather&lt;/tire&gt;\",\n#    \"&lt;tire&gt;studded&lt;/tire&gt;\",\n#    \"&lt;tire&gt;extra wide&lt;/tire&gt;\"]\n\nbike_tires = @doc.xpath('//bike:tire', 'bike' =&gt; 'http://bobsbikes.com/')\n# =&gt; [\"&lt;tire&gt;street&lt;/tire&gt;\", \"&lt;tire&gt;mountain&lt;/tire&gt;\"]\n</code></pre> <p>To make this namespace registration a bit easier, nokogiri will automatically register any namespaces it finds on the root node for you.  Nokogiri will associate the name in the declaration with the supplied URL.  If we stick to this naming convention, we can shorten up our code.</p> <p>Let's take this atom feed for example:</p> <pre><code>[atom.xml]\n&lt;?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?&gt;\n&lt;feed xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom\"&gt;\n\n  &lt;title&gt;Example Feed&lt;/title&gt;\n  &lt;link href=\"http://example.org/\"/&gt;\n  &lt;updated&gt;2003-12-13T18:30:02Z&lt;/updated&gt;\n  &lt;author&gt;\n    &lt;name&gt;John Doe&lt;/name&gt;\n  &lt;/author&gt;\n  &lt;id&gt;urn:uuid:60a76c80-d399-11d9-b93C-0003939e0af6&lt;/id&gt;\n\n  &lt;entry&gt;\n    &lt;title&gt;Atom-Powered Robots Run Amok&lt;/title&gt;\n    &lt;link href=\"http://example.org/2003/12/13/atom03\"/&gt;\n    &lt;id&gt;urn:uuid:1225c695-cfb8-4ebb-aaaa-80da344efa6a&lt;/id&gt;\n    &lt;updated&gt;2003-12-13T18:30:02Z&lt;/updated&gt;\n    &lt;summary&gt;Some text.&lt;/summary&gt;\n  &lt;/entry&gt;\n\n&lt;/feed&gt;\n</code></pre> <p>If we stick to the convention, we can grab all title tags like this</p> <pre><code>@doc.xpath('//xmlns:title') # =&gt; [\"&lt;title&gt;Example Feed&lt;/title&gt;\", \"&lt;title&gt;Atom-Powered Robots Run Amok&lt;/title&gt;\"]\n</code></pre> <p>Don't be fooled though.  You do not have to use XPath to get the benefits of namespaces.  CSS selectors can be used as well.  CSS just uses the pipe symbol to indicate a namespace search.</p> <p>Let's see the previous search rewritten to use CSS:</p> <pre><code>@doc.css('xmlns|title') # =&gt; [\"&lt;title&gt;Example Feed&lt;/title&gt;\", \"&lt;title&gt;Atom-Powered Robots Run Amok&lt;/title&gt;\"]\n</code></pre> <p>When using CSS, if the namespace is called \"xmlns\", you can even omit the namespace name.  That means your CSS will reduce to:</p> <pre><code>@doc.css('title') # =&gt; [\"&lt;title&gt;Example Feed&lt;/title&gt;\", \"&lt;title&gt;Atom-Powered Robots Run Amok&lt;/title&gt;\"]\n</code></pre> <p>Dealing with namespaces is a broad topic.
