# Installing Nokogiri

Welcome! We've spent quite a bit of time over the past year trying to make Nokogiri v1.11 easy and reliable to install. This page should hopefully get you on your way quickly.

## Meta

The current version of this page focuses on the installation experience for Nokogiri v1.11.x. If you're trying to install an earlier version, please visit:

- [Nokogiri v1.10.x installation instructions](https://github.com/sparklemotion/nokogiri.org/blob/91e624fa8d6c918d7905954fd8da7ea40f237d88/docs/tutorials/installing_nokogiri.md)

If this document doesn't address your problem, please jump over to [Getting Help](https://nokogiri.org/tutorials/getting_help.html).

If you'd like to contribute improvements to this document, please open a GitHub issue or pull-request on [nokogiri.org/installing_nokogiri.md](https://github.com/sparklemotion/nokogiri.org/blob/master/docs/tutorials/installing_nokogiri.md).


## Installing Native Gems

### Faster, more reliable installation

"Native gems" contain pre-compiled libraries for a specific machine architecture. On supported platforms, this removes the need for compiling the C extension and the packaged libraries, or for system dependencies to exist. This results in **much faster installation** and **more reliable installation**, which as you probably know are the biggest headaches for Nokogiri users.

### Supported Platforms

As of v1.11.0, Nokogiri ships pre-compiled, "native" gems for the following platforms:

- Linux: `x86-linux` and `x86_64-linux` (req: `glibc >= 2.17`), including musl platforms like Alpine
- Darwin/MacOS: `x86_64-darwin` and `arm64-darwin`
- Windows: `x86-mingw32` and `x64-mingw32`
- Java: any platform running JRuby 9.2 or higher

To determine whether your system supports one of these gems, look at the output of `bundle platform` or `ruby -e 'puts Gem::Platform.local.to_s'`.

If you're on a supported platform, either `gem install` or `bundle install` should install a native gem without any additional action on your part. This installation should only take a few seconds, and your output should look something like:

``` text
$ gem install nokogiri
Fetching nokogiri-1.11.0-x86_64-linux.gem
Successfully installed nokogiri-1.11.0-x86_64-linux
1 gem installed
```

If you're using Bundler v2.2+, check that your lockfile knows about your platform(s). For example, if you develop on macOS and deploy to Linux you will need to run these commands in your development environment:

``` sh
bundle lock --add-platform x86_64-linux
bundle install    # resolve dependencies for platform-specific gems
```

See `man bundle-lock` for details.


### Why would I not want to use a native gem?

I can imagine some folks might have trust issues; if this is you, please let us know in a comment at [RFC: Increase the level of trust in released gem files · Issue #2013 · sparklemotion/nokogiri](https://github.com/sparklemotion/nokogiri/issues/2013). What can we do to increase that trust? (I can imagine providing a chain of custody including public build logs with cryptographic hashes of artifacts, but I'd like to hear from real users.)

Anybody on a linux system old enough to not have `glibc >= 2.17` will need to install from the `ruby` platform gem.

If you have other reasons for not wanting to use a precompiled native gem, let us know! (See [Getting Help](https://nokogiri.org/tutorials/getting_help.html).)


### How can I avoid using a precompiled native gem?

The Nokogiri maintainers strongly urge you to use a native gem if at all possible. We expect it will be a much better experience for you and allow us to focus our efforts on improving functionality rather than diagnosing installation issues.

If you're on a platform that supports a native gem but you want to avoid using it in your project, do one of the following:

- If you're not using Bundler, then run `gem install nokogiri --platform=ruby`
- If you are using Bundler
  - version 2.1 or later, then you'll need to run `bundle config set force_ruby_platform true`,
  - version 2.0 or earlier, then you'll need to run `bundle config force_ruby_platform true`


## Installing the `ruby` platform gem

Again, we recommend that you upgrade to v1.11.x and use a native gem whenever possible. If you're here, it should be because you're on an older version, or you're on an unsupported platform.

**Before you begin, make sure you have the full compiler toolchain for compiling Ruby C Extensions.** See [Appendix A: The Compiler Toolchain](#appendix-a-the-compiler-toolchain).


### Installing Using The Packaged Libraries

Nokogiri packages its own updated and patched copies of [libxml2][] and [libxslt][] source code. By default, installation of Nokogiri will compile and use these packaged libraries.

If you don't see your operating system / distro in this section, then no additional setup is required beyond [Appendix A: The Compiler Toolchain](#appendix-a-the-compiler-toolchain). Just run `gem install nokogiri --platform=ruby`.


#### Ubuntu or Debian-based Distros

``` sh
sudo apt-get install zlib1g-dev liblzma-dev patch
gem install nokogiri --platform=ruby
```

You may substitute `git` for `patch` (`mini_portile2` can use either for applying patches).


#### Fedora, Red Hat, and CentOS

``` sh
dnf install -y zlib-devel
gem install nokogiri --platform=ruby
```


#### OpenBSD < 6.2

Use `gcc` from ports in order to compile the packaged libraries:

``` sh
pkg_add -v gcc
gem install nokogiri --platform=ruby
```


### Installing Using Standard System Libraries

Rather than use Nokogiri's packaged versions, you may prefer to use your system's or distro's standard libxml2/libxslt libraries. This section will try to help you do that.

Nokogiri will refuse to build against older, unsupported versions of `libxml2` and `libxslt`, and there may be some behavioral changes when using older versions. If you have installed libxml2 or libxslt to a custom location, please jump to the next section, [Installing With Custom / Non-Standard Libraries](#installing-with-custom-non-standard-libraries).

If you don't see your operating system or distro listed below, then no additional setup is required beyond [Appendix A: The Compiler Toolchain](#appendix-a-the-compiler-toolchain). Just run `gem install nokogiri --platform=ruby -- --use-system-libraries`. Or, if you're using bundler, `bundle config build.nokogiri --use-system-libraries`.


#### Debian/Ubuntu

``` sh
sudo apt-get install pkg-config libxml2-dev libxslt-dev
gem install nokogiri --platform=ruby -- --use-system-libraries
```


#### MacOS

If you're using homebrew:

``` sh
brew install libxml2 libxslt
gem install nokogiri --platform=ruby -- --use-system-libraries
```

If you're using macports and would like to contribute documentation, please open a GitHub issue or pull-request on [nokogiri.org/installing_nokogiri.md](https://github.com/sparklemotion/nokogiri.org/blob/master/docs/tutorials/installing_nokogiri.md).



#### FreeBSD

``` sh
sudo pkg install pkgconf
gem install nokogiri --platform=ruby -- --use-system-libraries
```


#### Windows

We recommend installing Nokogiri against the MSYS2 system libraries:

``` sh
ridk exec pacman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-libxslt
gem install nokogiri --platform=ruby -- --use-system-libraries
```


### Installing With Custom / Non-Standard Libraries

You may have your own custom version of libxml2/libxslt that you'd like to use. OK! Here we go.

Ideally you can install `pkg-config` and the installed libraries should self-describe how to compile and build against themselves.

But if:

* you've got `libxml2` and/or `libxslt` installed in a nonstandard place,
* and you don't have `pkg-config` installed

... then you can use command-line parameters to the `gem install` command to specify build parameters.

You can specify the installation root directory:

``` sh
gem install nokogiri -- \
    --use-system-libraries \
    --with-xml2-dir=/path/to/dir \
    --with-xslt-dir=/path/to/dir
```

or, you can specify include and library directories separately:

``` sh
gem install nokogiri -- \
    --use-system-libraries \
    --with-xml2-lib=/path/to/builds/lib \
    --with-xml2-include=/path/to/builds/include/libxml2 \
    --with-xslt-lib=/path/to/builds/lib \
    --with-xslt-include=/path/to/builds/include
```

*Note: By default, libxslt header files are installed into the root include directory, but libxml2 header files are installed into a subdirectory thereof named `libxml2`.*

It's likely that you'll also need to specify the location of your `zlib` and `iconv` (and possibly `exslt`) install directories as well. In that case, you can add the options:

``` sh
gem install nokogiri -- \
    --use-system-libraries \
    # ...
    --with-iconv-dir=/path/to/dir \
    --with-zlib-dir=/path/to/dir \
    [--with-exslt-dir=/path/to/dir]
    [--with-exslt-config=/path/to/exslt-config]
```

You can also tell bundler to remember these configuration parameters:

``` sh
bundle config build.nokogiri \
       --use-system-libraries \
       --with-xml2-lib=/usr/local/lib \
       --with-xml2-include=/usr/local/include/libxml2/libxml \
       --with-xslt-lib=/usr/local/lib \
       --with-xslt-include=/usr/local/include/libxslt \
       --with-iconv-lib=/usr/local/lib \
       --with-iconv-include=/usr/local/include
```

Do not attempt Bundler installation using Bundler versions before v1.8.3 (see [bundler/bundler#3053](https://github.com/bundler/bundler/issues/3053) for details). If you really must, see earlier git history of [this file](https://github.com/sparklemotion/nokogiri.org/blob/master/docs/tutorials/installing_nokogiri.md), which includes a workaround.


### Installing Third-Party Distributions of Nokogiri

#### Debian

See https://packages.debian.org/sid/ruby-nokogiri

``` sh
sudo apt-get install ruby-nokogiri
```

#### openSUSE/SLE

See https://download.opensuse.org/repositories/devel:/languages:/ruby:/extensions/


#### Fedora, Red Hat, and CentOS

You may install the appropriate [epel-release][] and get the Nokogiri package from [EPEL][] using:

``` sh
sudo dnf install -y rubygem-nokogiri
```

  [EPEL]: http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/EPEL
  [epel-release]: http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/EPEL#How_can_I_use_these_extra_packages.3F


#### GNU Guix

Install on any Linux distribution using [GNU Guix](https://www.gnu.org/software/guix/), a reproducible binary software package management and distribution system.

Use this command:

``` sh
guix package -i ruby-nokogiri
```

*Note: source code is available [here](http://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/guix.git/tree/gnu/packages/ruby.scm). A short description of how Nokogiri was packaged can be found [here](https://github.com/pjotrp/guix-notes/blob/master/RUBYGEMS-Nokogiri.org).*


### Other Installation Scenarios

#### Alpine Docker Images

To just install the native gem:

``` Dockerfile
FROM ruby:3.0-alpine

RUN gem install nokogiri
```

To compile with the packaged libraries:

``` Dockerfile
FROM ruby:3.0-alpine

RUN apk add --no-cache build-base
RUN gem install nokogiri --platform=ruby
```

To compile against Alpine's own XML libraries, add the necessary development tools and libraries to the image.

``` Dockerfile
FROM ruby:3.0-alpine

RUN apk add --no-cache build-base libxml2-dev libxslt-dev
RUN gem install nokogiri --platform=ruby -- --use-system-libraries
```

When optimizing the size of an Alpine image, the runtime libraries must be permanently added. Additionally, adding and removing development tooling can be chained with gem installation to ensure a small layer.

``` Dockerfile
FROM ruby:3.0-alpine

RUN apk add --no-cache libxml2 libxslt && \
        apk add --no-cache --virtual .gem-installdeps build-base libxml2-dev libxslt-dev && \
        gem install nokogiri --platform=ruby -- --use-system-libraries && \
        rm -rf $GEM_HOME/cache && \
        apk del .gem-installdeps
```

This approach nets an 12.1 MB layer (versus 18.1 MB without `--use-system-libraries`)
and saves over 170 MB in build tools.


#### Termux
Although Termux isn't fully supported right now, some people have reported success getting Nokogiri installed on it by running these commands:

``` sh
pkg install ruby clang make pkg-config libxslt binutils
bundle config set force_ruby_platform true
gem install nokogiri --platform=ruby -- --use-system-libraries
```


#### SmartOS (Nonstandard)

SmartOS installation requires building and using libxml2/libxslt/libiconv in a nonstandard location. Building on the previous section, here's how to do it:

(Note: `pkgsrc` is included in JPC SmartOS instances)

``` sh
pkgin install ruby gcc49 libxml2 libxslt zlib libiconv ruby22-rake gmake
ln -s /opt/local/gcc49/bin/gcc /opt/local/bin/gcc

gem install nokogiri -- \
    --use-system-libraries \
    --with-xml2-lib=/opt/local/lib \
    --with-xml2-include=/opt/local/include/libxml2 \
    --with-xslt-lib=/opt/local/lib \
    --with-xslt-include=/opt/local/include/libxslt \
    --with-iconv-lib=/opt/local/lib \
    --with-iconv-include=/opt/local/include \
    --with-zlib-dir=/opt/local/lib
```

See the previous section for guidance on how to instruct Bundler to use these options.


## Troubleshooting

### `cannot load such file -- nokogiri/nokogiri (LoadError)`

Particularly when upgrading to a newer version of Ruby, this error appears at runtime.

#### Symptoms

Installation succeeds, but then at runtime this error message is seen:

``` text
kernel_require.rb:23:in `require': cannot load such file -- nokogiri/nokogiri (LoadError)
```

#### Solution

Uninstall *all* versions of Nokogiri on your system, and then re-resolve your dependencies (using `bundle` or `gem install`).

This error can occur when a version of Nokogiri installed for a different version of Ruby is used by an unsupported version of Ruby. For example, if Nokogiri v1.12.5-x86_64-linux installed by Ruby 3.0 is then used by Ruby 3.1, you'll see this error (note that nokogiri v1.12.5 native gems do not support Ruby 3.1).


### Using `vendor/cache` to deploy to another architecture

A common workflow is for a team to develop on a Mac but deploy to production on Linux. This workflow depends on Bundler caching an appropriate gem file in `vendor/cache`. Unfortunately, in this situation Bundler's default behavior is to cache only gems for the development system and not the production system, leading to an error at deploy time.


#### Symptoms

During deployment, the buildpack may fail to find a relevant gem in `vendor/cache` and emit an error like this (from Heroku):

``` text hl_lines="8-11"
-----> Ruby app detected
-----> Installing bundler 2.1.4
-----> Removing BUNDLED WITH version in the Gemfile.lock
-----> Compiling Ruby/Rails

       Running: BUNDLE_WITHOUT='development:test' BUNDLE_PATH=vendor/bundle BUNDLE_BIN=vendor/bundle/bin BUNDLE_DEPLOYMENT=1 bundle install -j4
       Some gems seem to be missing from your vendor/cache directory.
       Could not find nokogiri-1.11.0 in any of the sources
       Bundler Output: Some gems seem to be missing from your vendor/cache directory.
       Could not find nokogiri-1.11.0 in any of the sources
 !
 !     Failed to install gems via Bundler.
 !
 !     Push rejected, failed to compile Ruby app.
 !     Push failed
```

#### Solution

Bundler 2.2 and later has *great* multiplatform support and allows you to cache gems for multiple platforms. You can run commands like these to cause Bundler to fetch and cache gems for all the named platforms:

``` sh
bundle lock --add-platform x86_64-darwin
bundle lock --add-platform x86_64-linux
bundle package --all-platforms
```

For more information, please read [this wonderful blog post](https://blog.thegnar.co/caching-all-native-gem-platforms) written by Kevin Murphy explaining this approach.


#### Fallback Solution

If you can't upgrade to Bundler 2.2 (or later), you can force older versions to always use the `ruby` platform, which supports all platforms, but applies to *all* gems and comes with the installation challenges mentioned earlier in this guide.

Here's how to do this with Bundler 2.1 or later:

``` sh
rm -rf vendor/cache
bundle config set force_ruby_platform true
bundle install
```

Or if you're on version 2.0 or earlier:

``` sh
rm -rf vendor/cache
bundle config force_ruby_platform true
bundle install
```


### [Linux musl] "Error loading shared library"

Musl-based systems like Alpine may not have a glibc-compatible library installed, leading to problems running the precompiled native gems.

#### Symptoms

Installation succeeds, but then at runtime you'll see an error like this:

``` text
Error loading shared library ld-linux-x86-64.so.2: No such file or directory
```

or like this if you're on ARM64:

``` text
Error loading shared library ld-linux-aarch64.so.1: No such file or directory
```

#### Solution

Install the glibc compatibility layer:

``` sh
apk add gcompat
```

See https://wiki.alpinelinux.org/wiki/Running_glibc_programs for more details.


### Cannot install `racc`

As of v1.11.0, Nokogiri is declaring an explicit dependency on `racc ~> 1.4`, which itself is a C extension that users may have trouble installing.


#### Symptoms

You may see an error message like this:

``` text hl_lines="1-2 25-26"

extconf failed, exit code 1
```

#### Solution 1 - Compiler toolchain

Racc needs the same compiler toolchain to be present as any Gem with a C extension. See [Appendix A: The Compiler Toolchain](#appendix-a-the-compiler-toolchain).


#### Solution 2 - Avoid installing Racc

Ruby 3.0 comes with Racc 1.5.x as a "builtin gem", so you could update to Ruby 3!

Ruby 2.7 comes with Racc 1.4.x as a "builtin gem", so you could use that version instead of trying to upgrade. Update to Ruby 2.7 and add a line like `gem "racc", "~> 1.4.0"` to prevent bundler from trying to upgrade.



### [Linux] `/usr/bin/ld: cannot find -lgmp`

If you're compiling the `ruby` platform gem, and if you've installed Ruby using RVM, [you may require libgmp](https://github.com/rvm/rvm/issues/3509).

#### Symptoms

Gem installation fails with an error message like:

``` sh
/home/user/.rvm/rubies/ruby-2.2.3/lib/ruby/2.2.0/mkmf.rb:456:in `try_do': The compiler failed to generate an executable file. (RuntimeError)
You have to install development tools first.
```

And examination of your `mkmf.log` file shows:

``` sh
/usr/bin/ld: cannot find -lgmp
```

#### Solution

Run `sudo apt-get install libgmp-dev`.


### [MacOS] `xcode-select` errors with a 'network problem'

If you're compiling the `ruby` platform gem ...

#### Symptoms

You see this dialog when you run the commands to update xcode commandline tools:

![xcode-select-network-problem](images/xcode-select-network-problem.png)

#### Solution

Run this command to turn off forced-authentication with Apple Software Update:

``` sh
sudo defaults delete /Library/Preferences/com.apple.SoftwareUpdate CatalogURL
```

### [MacOS] `error: use of undeclared identifier 'LZMA_OK'`

If you're compiling the `ruby` platform gem ...

#### Symptoms

An error during Nokogiri installation mentions an undeclared identifier `LZMA_OK`:

``` text
xmlIO.c:1450:52: error: use of undeclared identifier 'LZMA_OK'
    ret =  (__libxml2_xzclose((xzFile) context) == LZMA_OK ) ? 0 : -1;
                                                   ^
1 error generated.
```

#### Diagnosis

When using Homebrew, there are several libraries that use a formula called `xz` (including `the_silver_searcher` and `imagemagick`), which by default install a version of `liblzma` that is incompatible with most Ruby builds.  (Homebrew installs only the 64-bit version of the library, but most Ruby builds are universal.) This can be fixed in a couple of ways:


#### Solution 1

The most reliable solution appears to be temporarily unlinking `xz` and relinking it during an install of `nokogiri`:

``` sh
brew unlink xz
gem install nokogiri # or bundle install
brew link xz
```

#### Solution 2

The other solution is to use a Homebrew-installed `libxml2`, as suggested in [Installing Using Standard System Libraries](#installing-using-standard-system-libraries).

``` sh
brew install libxml2
gem install nokogiri -- --use-system-libraries \
    --with-xml2-include=$(brew --prefix libxml2)/include/libxml2
```

or if you're using bundler:

``` sh
bundle config build.nokogiri --use-system-libraries \
    --with-xml2-include=$(brew --prefix libxml2)/include/libxml2
bundle install
```

When working with this, be certain to use `$(brew --prefix libxml2)` because it will use the correct location for your Homebrew install.


### [MacOS] `libiconv is missing`

Xcode 10 on macOS Mojave [moves the system headers][xcode10] out of `/usr/include` and so Nokogiri will fail to build when you're compiling the `ruby` platform gem.


#### Symptoms

You'll see an error similar to this:

``` text hl_lines="3"
Building nokogiri using packaged libraries.

libiconv is missing.  please visit http://nokogiri.org/tutorials/installing_nokogiri.html for help with installing dependencies.

*** extconf.rb failed ***
Could not create Makefile due to some reason, probably lack of necessary libraries and/or headers.
```

#### Solution

A temporary workaround to allow previous releases of Nokogiri to build is to install the extra headers package mentioned in the Xcode 10 release notes:

``` sh
open /Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/Packages/macOS_SDK_headers_for_macOS_10.14.pkg
```

You can also install the headers package from the command line (e.g. for a build script or a CI server):

``` sh
sudo installer -pkg /Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/Packages/macOS_SDK_headers_for_macOS_10.14.pkg -target /
```


### [MacOS] General MacOS Tips

If you're seeing other problems:

* Make sure ruby is compiled with the latest clang compiler.
* Binary gems and ruby should be compiled with the same compiler/environment.
* If you have multiple versions of Xcode installed, make sure you use the right `xcode-select`.
* Try [Installing Using Standard System Libraries](#installing-using-standard-system-libraries).


## Appendix A: The Compiler Toolchain

A good way to tell if you've got your basic Ruby C extension compiler toolchain installed correctly is to try installing the `bcrypt` gem which has a smaller, self-contained C extension. If you can `gem install bcrypt`, you're all set!

Reminder: if you're installing a native gem, you don't need to do this.


### Ubuntu or Debian-based Distros

``` sh
sudo apt-get install build-essential ruby-dev
```


### Fedora, Red Hat, and CentOS

``` sh
dnf install -y make gcc rpm-build ruby-devel
```


### Alpine

``` sh
apk add build-base
```


### Windows

Please visit [RubyInstaller](https://rubyinstaller.org/) and make sure you install a version "With Devkit".


### MacOS

First, make sure you have the latest version of RubyGems and xcode commandline tools:

``` sh
gem update --system
xcode-select --install # Then agree to the terms, even if you have done this before!
```

Agree to the Xcode license:

``` sh
sudo xcodebuild -license
```
